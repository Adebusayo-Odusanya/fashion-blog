            <h2>What are boyfriend jeans</h2>
            <p>Boyfriend jeans are slouchy denim pants with a loose fit through the thighs and waist, meant to capture the look of a person borrowing their boyfriend’s worn-in jeans. Boyfriend jeans come in high-waist styles but traditionally sit lower on the waist to create a baggy silhouette. Unlike skinny jeans and mom jeans, boyfriend jeans do not have a tapered leg, making them similar to straight-leg jeans.</p>

            <h2>How to style boyfriend jeans</h2>
            <p>A pair of boyfriend jeans is a versatile addition to any capsule wardrobe because you can pair these classic, comfortable jeans with various outfits. Wearing boyfriend jeans is easy if you follow these six styling tips.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Balance your outfit.</strong> Balance out the bagginess of your boyfriend jeans with fitted tops (like a ribbed knit turtleneck or fitted bodysuit). Pair high-waisted boyfriend jeans with a crop top and low-waisted boyfriend jeans with a longer shirt, like a button-down, or a cardigan. Experiment with low-rise and mid-rise styles to help lengthen or shorten your torso.</li>
                <li><strong>Change up the color.</strong> Boyfriend jeans come in nearly every color, from a dark wash to a light one, and even black, white, or grey. Keep in mind that the different washes have different effects. Dark or black denim has a narrowing effect, and lighter washes draw attention to your jeans.</li>
                <li><strong>Cuff the legs.</strong> Boyfriend jeans are perfect to wear cuffed, which allows you to show off your footwear and lengthen the look at the same time. To cuff your jean ankles, fold up the first inch of denim from the pant hem. Roll the fabric over itself one more time to achieve a versatile skinny roll that you can wear with anything. Pair your skinny-rolled jeans with flat sneakers or loafers. Roll your jeans into a single wide cuff for a neater style or a loose, double-folded cuff for a more boho look. Experiment with different cuff types to see which one complements your shape and style to your liking.</li>
                <li><strong>Experiment with different shoes.</strong> Both the length of your boyfriend jeans and the cuff style can determine which shoes work best with your outfit. People with shorter frames may prefer a pair of platform shoes, high heels, or sleek block-heeled booties, which can help lengthen the legs. Style your favorite distressed boyfriend jeans with motorcycle-style ankle boots, a worn-in white T-shirt, and a leather jacket for a classic yet edgy combo. Experiment with shoes of different ankle heights to play with the proportions of your outfit.</li>
                <li><strong>Mind the fit.</strong> Boyfriend-cut jeans are meant to be oversized but should still highlight your specific shape. The thighs and waist should be slightly loose but not so baggy that they’re falling down. Those with taller frames may enjoy the way extra wide-leg boyfriend jeans look. People with petite frames may prefer a more slim-legged boyfriend jean because the extra fabric may tend to swallow up their bottom half.</li>
                <li><strong>Try a formal look.</strong> Many designers showcase worn-in or ripped boyfriend jeans, which you might associate with a casual look, but you can easily dress this style up. Style a pair of cuffed boyfriend jeans with a tucked-in button-up blouse, an oversized blazer, and strappy heels for a classic formal vibe. Tuck a sleek turtleneck into boyfriend-style baggy jeans and finish the look with stilettos and a decorative belt.</li>
